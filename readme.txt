== Installation ==

*   Go to __WordPress Admin__ > __Plugins__ > __Add New__ from the left-hand menu
*   In the search box type __VellaPay WooCommerce Payment Gateway__
*   Click on Install now when you see __VellaPay WooCommerce Payment Gateway__ to install the plugin
*   After installation, __activate__ the plugin.


= Vella Setup and Configuration =
*   Go to __WooCommerce > Settings__ and click on the __Payments__ tab
*   You'll see Vella listed along with your other payment methods. Click __Set Up__
*   On the next screen, configure the plugin. There is a selection of options on the screen. Read what each one does below.

1. __Enable/Disable__ - Check this checkbox to Enable Vella on your store's checkout
2. __Title__ - This will represent Vella on your list of Payment options during checkout. It guides users to know which option to select to pay with Vella. __Title__ is set to "Make Payment with Vella" by default, but you can change it to suit your needs.
3. __Description__ - This controls the message that appears under the payment fields on the checkout page. Use this space to give more details to customers about what Vella is and what payment methods they can use with it.
4. __Test Mode__ - Check this to enable test mode. When selected, the fields in step five will say "Test" instead of "Live." Test mode enables you to test payments before going live. The orders are processed with test payment methods, no money is involved so there is no risk. You can uncheck this when your store is ready to accept real payments.

5. __API Keys__ - The next two text boxes are for your Vella API keys, which you can get from your Vella Dashboard. If you enabled Test Mode in step four, then you'll need to use your test API keys here. Otherwise, you can enter your live keys.
6. Click on __Save Changes__ to update the settings.

To account for poor network connections, which can sometimes affect order status updates after a transaction, we __strongly__ recommend that you set a Webhook URL on your Vella dashboard. This way, whenever a transaction is complete on your store, we'll send a notification to the Webhook URL, which will update the order and mark it as paid. You can set this up by using the URL in red at the top of the Settings page. Just copy the URL and save it as your webhook URL on your Vella dashboard under __Settings > API Keys & Webhooks__ tab.

If you do not find Vella on the Payment method options, please go through the settings again and ensure that:

*   You've checked the __"Enable/Disable"__ checkbox
*   You've entered your __API Keys__ in the appropriate field
*   You've clicked on __Save Changes__ during setup
